### Claude AI Prompt Used

```
Attached are two html files to use as a template for your response.  All css and javascript has already been taken care of outside of these files and you only need to update the HTML using the existing structure with the content that you provide.  The first file is of the form "essay-YYYY-MM-DD.html".  The second file is of the form "vocabGrammar-YYYY-MM-DD.html", where the date parameters should be today's date.

I am learning Japanese and need easy reading material at the JLPT N5 / N4 levels.  Given the current month and day (ignore year), please pick an interesting historical event that took place on said month and day and write a one-page essay of 10 lines or more of Japanese.  Follow the first file I provided, which includes furigana for the Japanese as well as English translations.  For the second file, please provide the corresponding vocabulary and grammar patterns used following the same structure as the second file.
